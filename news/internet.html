    <img src="../newsphotos/internet-1.jpg" alt="internet photo" loading="lazy">

    <p>Recent reports have surfaced revealing a terrifying situation regarding web pages, showing that a large portion of the web is disappearing, creating a massive void on the internet. According to the report, around 39% of active web pages since 2013 have vanished. Learn more on GamerSight.</p>

    <p>Many users believe that the internet can serve as an eternal archive of human knowledge, but it seems things are not going as planned. The report indicates that 39% of all active web pages since 2013 have disappeared, and even newer pages are vanishing rapidly.</p>

    <h2>The Threat of Content Disappearance Looms Over the Internet</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/internet-2.jpg" alt="internet photo" loading="lazy">

    <p>This report, published by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, highlights the existence of a nonprofit organization called Internet Archive, which aims to preserve our online past.</p>

    <p>Founded in 1996, Internet Archive is one of humanityâ€™s most important efforts to preserve digital heritage. This organization serves as a comprehensive digital library, storing web content. To date, it has archived around 866 billion web pages, 44 million books, and 10.6 million videos.</p>

    <p>Internet Archive also offers a tool called Wayback Machine, which allows users to view deleted or altered website content. However, this internet time machine also faces new legal and technical challenges.</p>

    <p>Wikipedia, one of the largest databases, now faces significant issues with "link rot" or decaying links. This means that the links to the pages cited by Wikipedia no longer exist.</p>

    <p>According to a report by ecoticias, the problem of disappearing internet content has also spread to social networks. For example, about 15% of tweets are deleted within a few months after being posted. In any case, the internet is currently facing an issue that could affect its future, pushing many organizations to consider solutions to tackle this problem.</p>
