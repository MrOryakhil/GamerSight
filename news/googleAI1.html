    <h1>Google CEO Claims AI Won’t Replace Programmers amid Rising Concerns</h1>
            <img src="../newsphotos/sundarprachai.webp" alt="Sundar Prachai Photo" loading="lazy">
            <p>In a recent statement, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made a bold claim, asserting that artificial intelligence (AI) will never replace various industries, including programmers. This comes in stark contrast to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s earlier remarks, where he suggested that AI would dominate the programming field, eliminating the need for new programmers altogether.</p>
            <p>Huang had recently predicted that AI would advance so rapidly that the role of programmers would soon become obsolete. He even went so far as to advise parents against teaching their children programming, encouraging them to invest their time in learning other skills.</p>
            <p>However, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (Google's parent company), has taken a vastly different stance on the impact of AI on entry-level programmers. His view diverges from Nvidia’s CEO, emphasizing that AI is more of a tool, not a replacement for human jobs.</p>
        <h2>AI is a Tool, Not a Threat</h2>

        <p>As reported by Wccftech, Pichai also highlighted Google’s ambitious plans to develop renewable energy sources to power its AI systems. He stressed that AI should be seen as a collaborative tool rather than a competitor to human intelligence.</p>
        <p>In simpler terms, Pichai believes that AI is meant to streamline processes and assist humans, not take their place in the workforce.</p>
        <p>When asked specifically about the possibility of AI replacing entry-level programmers, Pichai responded:<br/>
            "This question applies to many fields. I believe the most likely scenario is that AI will assist people, not replace them."</p>
        <p>He went on to explain that AI, as a developing tool, is designed to help people save time and energy in various work sectors.</p>
