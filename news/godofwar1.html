    <h1>God of War: Ragnarok Faces Backlash After PC Launch on Steam Due to PSN Account Requirement</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/Capture3.JPG" alt="God of War Ragnarok Photo" loading="lazy">
    <p>Just days ago, God of War: Ragnarok finally made its way to PC via Steam, nearly two years after its original release on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. However, what should have been an exciting moment for PC gamers quickly turned sour as players were hit with an unexpected challenge: despite being a single-player game, Ragnarok requires a PlayStation Network (PSN) account and an active internet connection to play.</p>
    <p>The requirement for a PSN account has prevented users from playing the game offline, leading to frustration among many, especially those who prefer offline gaming experiences. As a result, God of War: Ragnarok has been bombarded with negative reviews since its Steam release. This backlash is particularly noteworthy as Sony recently had to reverse a similar policy for Helldivers 2, following a flood of player complaints.</p>

    <h2>Wave of Negative Reviews for God of War: Ragnarok</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/gameplay.JPG" alt="God of War Ragnarok Photo" loading="lazy">
    <p>While Helldivers 2 shares some similarities with Ragnarok, there are key differences. For one, Helldivers 2 was originally released without requiring a PSN connection, and adding this restriction post-launch ruined the experience for many players, especially those in regions with limited access to PSN. Secondly, as a multiplayer game, Helldivers 2 naturally required an internet connection, whereas Ragnarok is purely single-player, making the inability to play offline even more frustrating for users, particularly those using handheld devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, the flood of negative reviews for God of War: Ragnarok is unfortunate, especially considering the game itself is critically acclaimed and of high quality. In fact, the PC version of the game appears to be well-optimized and includes all the expected features of a PlayStation-to-PC port. However, the issue lies not with the game's content but with Sony’s imposition of an unnecessary requirement for PSN connectivity in a single-player game. This policy, likely tied to digital rights management (DRM), only harms legitimate customers who purchased the game.</p>
    <p>With any luck, Sony might reconsider its decision, just as it did with Helldivers 2. If the company is truly still “learning the best way to cater to PC gamers,” as they’ve previously claimed, they should pay closer attention to player feedback and avoid forcing unnecessary PSN login requirements in future PC releases.</p>
    <p>Will Sony adjust its approach? Only time will tell, but players are hopeful that the company listens to the community's concerns.</p>
