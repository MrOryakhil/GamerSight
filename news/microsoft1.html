    <h1>Microsoft Buys Nuclear Power Plant to Fuel Its AI Data Centers</h1>
            <img src="../newsphotos/nuclearpower.webp" alt="Nuclear Power Plant" loading="lazy">
            <p>Modern AI data centers consume massive amounts of energy, pushing companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI to seek sustainable energy sources for their operations. In this context, Microsoft has announced plans to spend $1.6 billion to restore and repurpose the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant.</p>
            <p>According to a Bloomberg report, Microsoft recently signed a deal to restart the nuclear plant to power its data centers. The company is investing around $1.6 billion to relaunch the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania.</p>

        <h2>A Massive Power Source for Microsoft's Data Centers</h2>

        <p>Once restored, the reactor will supply electricity to Microsoft’s data centers for 20 years, meeting the energy needs of the tech giant’s AI and cloud computing operations. The reactor’s capacity is approximately 819 megawatts—enough to power a medium-sized city with hundreds of thousands of homes.</p>
        <p>According to Tom’s Hardware, the nuclear plant is expected to become operational by 2028, exclusively serving Microsoft’s needs. Interestingly, the plant was shut down in 2019 due to economic reasons.</p>
        <p>Microsoft had been in negotiations with the plant's owners for some time, and they have finally reached an agreement. The restoration work will include extensive upgrades to key equipment such as the main transformer, turbine, and cooling systems. Additionally, Microsoft is pursuing a license extension to operate the reactor until 2054.</p>
        <p>The decision to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant comes amid a growing interest in nuclear energy among tech companies. Microsoft has also pledged to power its entire global data center network with clean energy by 2025, and this nuclear deal will help achieve that goal.</p>
        
        <h2>Tech Giants Turning to Nuclear Energy</h2>

        <p>In addition to Microsoft, Amazon's cloud division has signed a $650 million deal to purchase a data center connected to a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Oracle has also announced plans to use three small nuclear reactors to power its future AI data centers, which will require up to one gigawatt of energy.</p>
        <p>To improve accessibility for users across different operating systems, from iOS and macOS to Android, Microsoft recently released the Windows app. This app acts as a cloud-based computing space, allowing users to remotely access and control Windows services.</p>
