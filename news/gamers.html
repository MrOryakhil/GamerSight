        <p>Recently, new studies about the status of gamers have been released, providing us with intriguing information. It appears that online multiplayer games havenâ€™t gained much favor, as about 53% of gamers prefer to engage in single-player games.</p>
        
        <p>It seems that gamers' tastes haven't changed much, and single-player games are still highly popular. In this regard, a study shows that about 53% of gamers are interested in single-player experiences.</p>

        <p>A study points out that most AAA game revenue comes from in-game purchases, usually through live services. However, the market has become oversaturated, and many live games have failed from the start.</p>

        <p>In fact, very few live games have managed to establish a name for themselves in the market. Every successful new game reduces the space for newcomers. While many AAA developers for consoles and PCs try to earn more from the online section of their games, most gamers still prefer single-player experiences.</p>

        <h2>Gamers' Tastes Are Changing!</h2>
        <p>Developers who previously created single-player games and attempted to break into the online multiplayer market have realized that this has been a catastrophic failure for them.</p>

        <p>An example of this is <i>The Last of Us</i>, which achieved great success, but <i>The Last of Us Online</i> had little chance and was quickly abandoned.</p>

        <p>While multiplayer titles like <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i> exist, <i>Elden Ring</i> sold around 25 million copies, and <i>Black Myth: Wukong</i> garnered the interest of 20 million gamers.</p>

        <p>Gamers' preferences change with age. For instance, teenagers are more inclined toward multiplayer games, but this trend starts to decline after the age of 20. Gamers over 25 tend to prefer single-player titles.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, gamers who prefer single-player experiences often use handheld consoles like the Steam Deck or PlayStation Portal. What do you think? Do you prefer playing solo, or are you a fan of multiplayer games?</p>
