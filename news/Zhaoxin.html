    <h1>Zhaoxin KX-7000 Processor: Performance Review & Gaming Benchmarks</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/Zhaoxin-KX-7000-1.jpg" alt="Zhaoxin-KX-7000-1" loading="lazy">
    <p>A comprehensive review of the Chinese Zhaoxin KX-7000 processor was recently released, highlighting its power and performance compared to Intel and AMD processors. The KX-7000 is one of the most advanced processors produced in China, making this review particularly significant.</p>

    <p>The Zhaoxin KX-7000, developed by Shanghai Zhaoxin, was first unveiled in December. Several benchmarks have surfaced since then, offering insight into its performance relative to existing processors in the market. While the results are not groundbreaking, they reflect the progress of Chinese manufacturers in the semiconductor industry.</p>

    <p>According to Tom's Hardware, the KX-7000 features eight cores with a boost clock speed of 3.7 GHz, DDR4/DDR5 memory support, and PCIe 4.0 compatibility. It also includes a ZX-C1190 integrated graphics core, developed in-house by Zhaoxin. The previous model, KX-U6880A, had eight cores but maxed out at 3.0 GHz and lacked support for DDR5 memory and PCIe 4.0.</p>

    <p>In comparison to Intel and AMD, the KX-7000's performance aligns with older entry-level processors such as Intelâ€™s Core i3-8100 and AMD's Ryzen 5 5600G. In Cinebench R23, its multi-thread performance is on par with the Core i3-8100, but only 60% of its single-thread performance. The Ryzen 5 5600G is roughly three times more powerful than the KX-7000 in both single-thread and multi-thread tests.</p>

    <h2>Gaming Benchmarks</h2>
    
    <p>For gaming performance, the KX-7000 was tested with an AMD RX 6400 GPU running <i>Dragon Quest X</i> and <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> at 1080p resolution. In <i>Dragon Quest X</i>, the processor achieved 60% of the Core i3-8100's performance, while in <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i>, it reached 90%. However, when compared to the Ryzen 5 5600G, the KX-7000 only managed to achieve 30% of its performance in <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i>.</p>

    <p>The integrated graphics core, ZX-C1190, scored very low in 3DMark Time Spy with only 42 points, compared to 469 for the Core i3-8100 and 1440 for the Ryzen 5 5600G, indicating significant gaps in graphical power.</p>
