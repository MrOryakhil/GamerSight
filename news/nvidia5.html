    <h1>China Introduces New GPU: Ascend 910C Targets AI Market</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/china-AI-market.jpg" alt="LENOVO LEGION 2 HERO" loading="lazy">
    <p>A prototype of the latest Chinese-made GPU, called <strong>Ascend 910C</strong>, has been sent to major companies in the server and internet sectors. This chip, an upgraded version of the Ascend 910B, has been developed to challenge NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI market.</p>

    <p>It appears that China’s newest GPU is ready for AI-related computations, and early samples have reached select customers. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, sources close to Huawei claim that the company has sent samples of its new Ascend 910C chip to some of the major players in the country’s server and internet industries.</p>

    <p>While the Ascend 910C is an upgraded version of the 910B, no detailed information about its architecture or capabilities is available at this time. However, some technology analysts suggest that this new chip could even outperform NVIDIA’s AI processor, the B20, from the Blackwell family.</p>

    <h2>US Sanctions Benefiting Chinese Companies?</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/Ascend-910C-china-AI-market-2.jpg" alt="LENOVO LEGION 2 HERO" loading="lazy">

    <p>According to <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>, over the past year, the United States has imposed strict technology restrictions, officially banning China's legal access to NVIDIA's high-end GPUs. This has had a significant negative impact on the development and speed of AI in the country. As a result, Chinese companies have decided to take matters into their own hands and fill this gap.</p>

    <p>Given that it seems unlikely that these technology sanctions will be lifted anytime soon, Chinese tech companies are taking their chances to enter this large market and develop products that rival their international competitors.</p>

    <p>Reports suggest that the H20, NVIDIA's most powerful GPU, which is not banned from sale in China, is expected to sell one million units, valued at $12 billion. This is significantly higher than the sales of the Chinese Ascend 910C, which reportedly sold only 70,000 units (with an estimated value of $2 billion) in August.</p>

    <h2>Challenges Ahead for Chinese AI Processors</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/Ascend-910C-china-AI-market-3.jpg" alt="LENOVO LEGION 2 HERO" loading="lazy">
    <p>For Chinese companies to succeed in this sector and compete with products like the H20 (and other GPUs available in China), they will need to contend with the powerful <strong>CUDA ecosystem</strong>. CUDA is a highly influential ecosystem that has even been a major obstacle for the ambitions of companies like AMD and Intel.</p>

    <p>What do you think about Chinese companies' efforts to produce a powerful GPU and take over NVIDIA's share of the AI market? Will they succeed in the near future?</p>
