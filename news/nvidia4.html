    <h1>NVIDIA is Preparing to Unveil the Next Generation of Graphics Cards: Leaks Reveal Exciting Details!</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/5080.jpg" alt="RTX 5080" loading="lazy">
    <p>It seems that NVIDIA is gearing up for the introduction of its next-gen graphics cards, and some exciting details have leaked about these cards. The "Green Team" appears to be planning a 24GB version of the RTX 5080 in addition to the 16GB model. Read more on <strong>GamerSight</strong>.</p>

    <p>According to the reports, after introducing the 16GB RTX 5080, NVIDIA will move on to another model with 24GB of video memory. Leaks regarding its configuration have also emerged.</p>

    <p>It appears that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 graphics cards will be unveiled at <strong>CES 2025</strong>, featuring a brand-new design.</p>

    <h2>NVIDIA RTX 5080 Specifications:</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/5080-1.jpg" alt="RTX 5080" loading="lazy">
    
    <p>The RTX 5080 is said to feature a similar VRAM configuration to the RTX 4080, boasting 16GB of memory with a 256-bit memory interface. However, this card uses the newer GDDR7 memory standard.</p>

    <p>The card will have 8 GDDR7 memory modules, each with 3GB of VRAM and operating at speeds between 28 to 32 Gbps. Therefore, NVIDIA might release a 24GB version of the RTX 5080 in the future.</p>

    <p>Based on reports from Wccftech, NVIDIA has two options moving forward. The first is to use the GB202 GPU, which will allow a 384-bit memory interface and a 24GB configuration. Alternatively, they could use 3GB VRAM modules.</p>

    <p>The RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 will have 16 and 8 GDDR7 modules, respectively, providing 32GB and 16GB of memory. However, with 3GB VRAM modules, the RTX 5080 could offer up to 24GB of video memory.</p>

    <p>The RTX 5080 features 10,752 CUDA cores and is equipped with 16GB of GDDR7 memory with a 256-bit memory bus. With memory speeds reaching 28Gbps, the bandwidth is halved compared to the RTX 5090, reaching 784GB/s.</p>

    <p>Although NVIDIA retains the same PCB design, core specs, and 256-bit memory configuration for this card, there's still a long way to go before <strong>CES 2025</strong>, and more leaks are expected in the coming days!</p>
