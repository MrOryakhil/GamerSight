    <p>KLEVV, a company that has recently gained significant popularity, even in our country, has introduced two new SSDs aimed at both high-end and budget PCs. Stay with us as we introduce these two storage devices.</p>

    <p>The first product, named <strong>GENUINE G560 Gen 5.0 SSD</strong>, is designed for high-end systems, offering impressive speed.</p>

    <p>This SSD uses the <strong>Gen5x4 NVMe on M.2 slot</strong>, with sequential read and write speeds reaching <strong>14,000 MB/s</strong> and <strong>12,000 MB/s</strong>, respectively, making it one of the fastest SSDs on the market.</p>

    <p>It is equipped with <strong>23x-Layer 3D NAND Flash</strong> technology, providing optimal efficiency alongside <strong>4K random speed</strong> of <strong>1,400K IOPS</strong>. The SSD will be available in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities, with a <strong>TBW of 3000</strong>, ensuring years of reliable use.</p>

    <p>Visually, this SSD features a <strong>white and black aluminum heatsink</strong> for cooling and aesthetic appeal. According to the manufacturer, this SSD also supports <strong>Microsoft DirectStorage</strong>, reducing game load times by up to 70% and lowering CPU usage by up to 99%.</p>

    <p>The second product, introduced for budget-friendly systems, is the <strong>CRAS C715 Gen 3 SSD</strong>, using <strong>PCI-E Gen 3x4</strong> interface. Its sequential read and write speeds reach <strong>3200 MB/s</strong> and <strong>2000 MB/s</strong>, respectively. It will be available in <strong>256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities</strong>.</p>

    <p>KLEVV has incorporated <strong>SLC technology</strong> with <strong>3D NAND Flash</strong> in this product for optimal performance on the older Gen 3 interface, alongside <strong>LPDC ECC</strong> for enhanced durability and reliability.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the company has not yet announced the prices for these SSDs, but both will be available for purchase in reputable online stores starting from October.</p>
