    <h1>God of War Ragnarok PC Port Faces Backlash, Mod Removes PSN Account Requirement</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/Capture3.JPG" alt="God of War Ragnarok Photo" loading="lazy">
    <p>The release of God of War Ragnarok on PC, unlike previous Sony titles, did not receive a warm welcome from gamers. In addition to technical issues at launch, the game requires players to log in to a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, which has resulted in a flood of negative reviews on Steam. However, recent news reveals that a new mod completely removes the PSN account requirement from God of War Ragnarok.</p>
    <p>According to WCCFtech, Steam users have heavily criticized God of War Ragnarok due to Sony's decision to mandate a PlayStation Network account login and the technical issues plaguing the game.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, a modder known as iArtorias has developed a new mod that removes the PSN account login requirement entirely. To install this mod, users simply need to download the files version.dll and PsPcSdk.dll and copy them into the game folder. The modder also advises users who encounter the login screen error after installing the mod to delete a specific file located in the path provided by the mod. Additionally, users should select “NO” in the first window that prompts them to link their Steam account.</p>

    <h2>New Patch Fixes Performance Issues</h2>

    <p>Additionally, the PC port developer, Jetpack Interactive, has released a second patch for the game, addressing issues related to NVIDIA’s Frame Generation technology. Several other bugs were also identified and fixed in this patch, including issues with the NVIDIA Reflex user interface and controller icon display bugs. Moreover, a limitation that prevented the game from running on GPUs with less than 6GB of memory has also been lifted.</p>
    <p>Given the problems surrounding God of War Ragnarok's launch, it's likely that more patches will be released in the future to address lingering issues. Despite the criticisms, the game continues to attract a significant number of players, and it appears that the developers are working to improve player satisfaction.</p>
