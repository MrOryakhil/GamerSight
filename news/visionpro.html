    <h1>Apple Vision Pro 2: New Features, M5 Chip & AI Capabilities</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/apple-vision-pro.jpg" alt="apple-vision-pro" loading="lazy">
    <p>According to Ming-Chi Kuo, a well-known Apple product analyst, Apple is working on the second generation of its Vision Pro headset, which is expected to feature new capabilities and improvements. Some of the key highlights of this new headset include the M5 chip and Apple Intelligence AI functionalities.</p>

    <p>Although the first generation of Vision Pro headsets did not resonate as expected with Apple users, the company is now in the process of designing Vision Pro 2. This new version is expected to have new features, aiming to increase appeal and reduce production costs, thereby attracting more customers.</p>

    <p>According to MacRumors, Apple is planning to start mass production of Vision Pro 2 in the second half of 2025. While the design will remain largely the same as its predecessor to cut costs, the M5 chip will provide enhanced performance compared to the M2 chip used in the first-generation Vision Pro.</p>

    <p>While Kuo expects Vision Pro 2 to be released by late 2025 or early 2026, other sources like Bloomberg speculate it might not hit the market until the end of 2026. One of the key features in this new headset will be the ability to run Apple Intelligence without relying on server connectivity, a feature expected to debut in visionOS 3 in 2025.</p>
