        <p>
            Firaxis Games, the studio behind the highly anticipated <strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</strong>, has just announced the minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version of the game. According to this information, most users with standard home systems will be able to run the game smoothly on low and medium settings, but a more powerful system will be needed to access its maximum graphical capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Civilization is one of the oldest game series that continues to release new versions. The first game in the series was released in 1991, and now, in 2025, <strong>Civilization VII</strong> will make its debut. This game was officially announced during the Summer Games Fest 2024, and we now have the full list of system requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to a report from Wccftech, Firaxis Games has provided details on three different system setups that users can utilize to play the game at 1080p or 4K, with 30 to 60 frames per second. While the minimum and medium recommended specs seem reasonable for most gamers, those aiming for the best graphical settings may need to consider upgrading their systems. Below are the full minimum and recommended system requirements for Civilization VII.

            The release of these system requirements has sparked debate among gamers, especially regarding the ULTRA settings. Many users have expressed their shock over the hardware requirements needed to play Civilization VII in 4K, as they have never needed such powerful setups to run previous games in the series at this resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fans of the Civilization series have been able to enjoy these games with simple and average setups in the past. However, this seems to be changing with Civilization VII, as players will need a GeForce RTX 4070, Radeon RX 7800 XT, or an even more powerful graphics card to access the game’s full graphical potential. Otherwise, the game will only be available to them with lower resolution and graphical settings.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</strong> is scheduled for release on February 11, 2025, and it will utilize Denuvo's anti-tamper technology at launch.</p>
