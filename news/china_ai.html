    <h1>China Telecom's TeleChat2 Chatbot Breakthrough</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/china-AI-market.jpg" alt="china-AI photo" loading="lazy">
    <p>China Telecom has announced that its TeleChat2 chatbot, featuring over 100 billion parameters, has been fully trained using processors made in China. Let's explore this claim further.</p>
    <p>According to The Register, the AI research institute of China Telecom has stated that an AI model with 100 billion parameters was trained using entirely domestic computing power. If true, this indicates that Western sanctions have not significantly hindered China's AI development.</p>
    <p>This model, named TeleChat2-115B, was announced in a GitHub update on September 20, stating it has been "fully trained using domestic computing power and is open-source." The project's GitHub page reveals that the model was trained using 10 trillion tokens from high-quality textual sources in both Chinese and English.</p>
    <img src="../newsphotos/china-telecom-1.jpg" alt="china-telecom photo" loading="lazy">
    <p>The GitHub page also notes that the model is compatible with Huawei's Ascend Atlas 800T A2 server, which supports Kunpeng 920 7265 and Kunpeng 920 5250 processors. These processors feature 64 cores running at 3.0 GHz and 48 cores running at 2.6 GHz, respectively, and are built using Arm 8.2 architecture and a 7-nanometer manufacturing process.</p>
    <p>While the number of parameters is not the sole metric for evaluating AI model performance, TeleChat2-115B with its 100 billion parameters falls behind more advanced models such as Llama, which has over 400 billion parameters, and OpenAI's o1 model, estimated to have around 200 billion parameters. The relatively lower parameter count might suggest a reduced computational power requirement for training this model, which could explain the lack of GPU mention in its specifications.</p>
    <p>It appears that the hardware used to train TeleChat2 differs from similar equipment outside of China. This situation may indicate that the export technology sanctions have not prevented China from achieving its AI development goals.</p>
    <p>China Telecom, with revenues exceeding $70 billion and over half a billion wired and wireless subscriptions, is one of the largest users and promoters of OpenStack, the free and open-source cloud computing standard.</p>
    <p>Do you think China can keep pace with its competitors in AI development without access to foreign hardware?</p>
