    <p>Qualcomm appears to be busy developing its next-generation processors, codenamed Project Glymur, with plans to release them in the coming year. Recent leaks reveal exciting details about the Snapdragon X2 processors, which are expected to come with a significant price reduction, making them strong contenders against Intel's Lunar Lake and AMD's Ryzen AI processors.</p>
    <p>While devices equipped with the current Snapdragon X processors have yet to fully enter the market, early information about the upcoming Snapdragon X2 has already surfaced. Qualcomm is reportedly focusing on developing the Snapdragon X2 processors for ARM-based computers and has tested a chip with the code SC8480XP.</p>
    <p>The Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors have already garnered attention from users due to their outstanding performance. Now, the news of the next generation of these chips is emerging, which could pose serious competition to Intel's Lunar Lake and AMD's Ryzen AI.</p>
    <p>The prototype of this chip, known as SC8480XP and codenamed Project Glymur, has been tested over the past two months. It's worth noting that the current generation of Snapdragon X processors is identified by the code SC8380XP.</p>
    <p>Qualcomm seems to be in the early stages of testing its next-generation chips, with initial evaluation platforms designed for testing prototypes. Additionally, rumors suggest that Qualcomm is developing two generations of Orion cores to be used in AI-driven computers based on Snapdragon X.</p>
    <p>According to reports from TechRadar, the Snapdragon X V2 chips are expected to be unveiled in the first half of 2025, followed by the Snapdragon V3 processors, which will enter the market by the end of 2027. This information was leaked by Dell.</p>
    <p>It has also been announced that a new lower-tier variant of the Snapdragon X Plus family, named X1P-24-100, is in development. This processor is expected to be octa-core, have a lower frequency, and exhibit weaker graphical performance.</p>
