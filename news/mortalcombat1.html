    <h2>NetherRealm’s Focus on Their Next Project</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/mortal-kombat-1-600x338.jpg" alt="Nether Realm Photo" loading="lazy">
    <p>According to a report from <strong>ComicBook</strong>, Ed Boon, the creator of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> series, has revealed that <strong>NetherRealm Studios</strong> has been working on its next project for the past three years. This announcement comes as the second year of <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> kicks off this week. Following the release of the <em>Khaos Reigns</em> expansion, NetherRealm plans to add new fighters like <strong>Ghostface</strong>, <strong>T-1000 Terminator</strong>, and <strong>Conan the Barbarian</strong> to the game.</p>
    <p>It remains unclear whether these characters will mark the final content for <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. However, Boon stated that NetherRealm has already planned their next steps for future projects.</p>



    <h2>Planning Ahead for the Future</h2>

    <p>Ed Boon explained that NetherRealm Studios had already selected their next project three years ago. With game development being a lengthy process, Boon emphasized the importance of planning ahead. He mentioned that developers need to know about their next game even before the release of the current one. This means that NetherRealm began working on their new title well before <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> was released.</p>
    <blockquote>“I’ve mentioned before that our planning for the next game starts before the release of the current one. There is a lot of work involved in planning and researching for a new project. It’s never been the case where we finish one game and then ask ourselves, ‘What should we do next?’ Our team has been working on something for three years now, and we knew what that game was since then,” said Boon.</blockquote>



    <h2>Future of NetherRealm's Next Project</h2>

    <p>Although Boon confirmed that NetherRealm is developing a new game, he did not provide further details. Before the release of <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, Boon had expressed his desire to return to the <em>Injustice</em> series. Fans were eagerly awaiting <em>Injustice 3</em>, but instead, the next <em>Mortal Kombat</em> was announced. As time has passed, player requests for <em>Injustice 3</em> have grown.</p>
    <p>It remains unclear what NetherRealm’s next project will be, and Boon suggests that we might not see an official reveal until 2025 or 2026. Meanwhile, <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is now available on <strong>Xbox Series X</strong>, <strong>Xbox Series S</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>PC</strong>. Additionally, the <em>Khaos Reigns</em> content for <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> will be available to players starting today.</p>
