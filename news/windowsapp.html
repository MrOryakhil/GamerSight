    <h1>New Windows App for Cloud-Based Remote Access</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/windowsapp.png" alt="windows app" loading="lazy">
    <p>Yesterday, Microsoft launched the Windows app for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, web browsers, Android devices, and even Windows PCs. The app essentially streams a version of Windows from various sources, including Windows 365, Azure Virtual Desktop, and Remote Desktop control.</p>
    <p>This new unified app has been in testing for nearly a year and includes features such as a customizable home screen, multi-monitor support, and USB redirection. This means you can use local devices like webcams, storage devices, and printers as if they were directly connected to the cloud computing space.</p>
    <p>However, the Windows app is limited to work and educational Microsoft accounts, primarily designed for existing Remote Desktop users across different operating systems.</p>
    <p>Microsoft has had similar programs for decades, including the Remote Desktop Connection, still part of Windows 11. These apps, including the new Windows app, are useful for connecting to work computers from personal laptops.</p>
    <p>According to The Verge, there’s no indication yet that Microsoft will extend support for consumer accounts with the new Windows app. Last year, Microsoft revealed its long-term goal to move Windows entirely to the cloud to "enable enhanced AI-based services and a fully roaming digital experience."</p>
    <p>For now, Windows users can download the Windows app from the Microsoft Store, while the app is also available on Apple’s App Store for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. An Android version is currently in public preview.</p>
