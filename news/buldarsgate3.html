    <p>Larian Studios has become one of the most successful developers of RPGs in recent years. With the Divinity: Original Sin series and, more recently, Baldur's Gate 3, the company has garnered both critical and player acclaim. Now that Baldur's Gate 3 has achieved major success, fans are eagerly waiting to see what Larian’s next project will be.</p>

    <p>According to IGN, Swen Vincke, head of Larian Studios, hinted at the release window for their next game during the SEA Game Awards 2024 in Malaysia. In his speech, he said, "We need to work hard on our next game so that we can be here in five years." This could imply that Larian's next game might be released around 2028 or 2029.</p>

    <p>However, immediately after the event, Vincke clarified in an interview with IGN that it was just a joke, saying, "I knew you would pick up on that. It was just a joke. I don't know, we'll release the game when it's ready. These are big games, and they take time to make, so don't count on a specific date."</p>

    <p>Larian Studios opened several branches around the world to develop Baldur's Gate 3. This strategy, known as 'following the sun,' allows them to work on the game 24/7 without overburdening the team.</p>

    <p>Vincke also talked about Larian’s next project, stating that expectations are very high. He advised his team to trust their instincts and emphasized that failure is a part of creativity and should not be feared.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, Vincke summarized Larian’s core game development philosophy: "Something you can proudly show your friends, and something you’d want to play yourself; that’s the core principle. If we have that, we will succeed."</p>

    <p>Now, we wait to see when Larian will reveal their next project. Do you think their next game can be as successful as Baldur's Gate 3?</p>
