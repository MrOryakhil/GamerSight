        <p>The latest installment in the popular Assassin’s Creed series, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, is facing a major challenge in its pre-sales. According to recent reports, the game has managed to achieve only 7% of the pre-sales that its predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, had at the same time before its release. This worrying statistic may be an indication that the new title is receiving less interest than expected.</p>

        <p>Pre-sales have become a crucial aspect of the video game market in recent years. They provide publishers with an early indication of a game's popularity and demand, while also generating significant initial revenue. Low pre-sales may indicate that publishers face challenges in marketing, advertising, or even delivering content that resonates with players.</p>

        <p>One of the largest global retailers also reported that physical pre-orders for Assassin’s Creed Shadows have fallen significantly below expectations. According to their data, fewer than 800 physical pre-orders have been recorded for the title in their store. In comparison, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, one of the franchise’s most successful entries, had far higher pre-sales during the same period. This signals concern not only for Ubisoft, the publisher and developer of the series, but also for retailers, as lower physical sales could impact the profitability of that segment in the video game market.</p>

        <p>It’s not just physical pre-sales that are underwhelming; digital pre-sales on major platforms such as the PlayStation Store are also reported to be much lower than expected. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games have been well-received for their unique storytelling and open-world gameplay, leading to millions of sales. However, it seems Assassin’s Creed Shadows has struggled to attract its usual early audience, which consists of both long-time and new fans of the series.</p>

        <p>Despite the grim pre-sales, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has not yet been officially released, and things could change after its launch. Often, initial player feedback and critical reviews can have a significant impact on a game’s post-launch sales. If Ubisoft can address potential issues with updates and offer a unique experience, there’s a chance that the game’s sales could improve following its release.</p>

        <p>However, considering the current situation and disappointing pre-sales figures, it appears that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is on a challenging path to success. This is concerning not only for Ubisoft but also for fans who have come to expect a rich narrative and engaging gameplay from the series. Time will tell if this game can meet expectations or not.</p>
