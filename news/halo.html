    <h1>Canceled Halo Battle Royale Project: What We Know So Far</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/helo.webp" alt="helo photos" loading="lazy">
    <p>The Halo series is one of the most popular first-person shooter franchises in the world of video games. Developed by 343 Industries, it has always had a dedicated fanbase. Recently, rumors surfaced about a battle royale version of the game, generating a lot of excitement among players. However, the project was later canceled, and now some interesting details have been leaked.</p>

    <p>According to Insider-Gaming, a content creator named Rebs Gaming recently released a video revealing details about Project Tatanka. This project, which was later renamed Ekhert, was essentially the Halo battle royale game. The report claims that Project Tatanka was canceled in 2023 so the studio could focus on the next main installment of Halo.</p>

    <p>Based on the leaked information, players would have entered a map made up of several fragments of Zeta Halo rings using drop pods similar to the ODST system. They could collect power items, equipment, and shields, and complete small missions. During the game, Pelicans would drop vehicles like Warthogs, Mongooses, and Falcons for players to use.</p>

    <p>Although this information has not been confirmed, it shows that 343 Industries had ambitious plans for a Halo battle royale game. However, for now, it seems the studio has chosen to focus on developing the next Halo title instead.</p>
