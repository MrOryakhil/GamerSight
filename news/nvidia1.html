    <h1>NVIDIA CEO Believes Moore's Law Is Over, RTX 5090 May Require Two 600W Connectors</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/rtx5090.webp" alt="rtx5090" loading="lazy">
    <p>NVIDIA's CEO never misses a chance to remind us that "Moore's Law" has reached its end, and he believes that future chip generations will inevitably be larger, hotter, and more power-hungry. Things get even more interesting when you hear that, according to some rumors, the next-generation RTX 5090 graphics card might require two 600W power connectors.</p>
    <p>NVIDIA's next-generation graphics architecture, known as Blackwell, promises significant improvements in performance-to-power consumption ratio at the architectural level, as well as better efficiency at the silicon level thanks to advanced TSMC 4NP manufacturing technology. However, rumors suggest that the GeForce RTX 5090, or the model that will replace the current RTX 4090, has an enormous appetite for power and may require two 16-pin inputs to supply electricity.</p>

    <h2>New Rumor: GeForce RTX 5090 Could Feature Two 12V-2x6 Connectors</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/12V-2x6.webp" alt="12V-2x6 Connectors" loading="lazy">
    <p>According to a report from TweakTown, the RTX 5090 might be equipped with two 16-pin power connectors, theoretically allowing the next NVIDIA flagship to consume up to 1200W of power. This doesn’t mean that the total graphics card power (TGP) is 1200W, but it could reach or exceed 600W, leading NVIDIA to opt for two connectors, as a single one wouldn’t suffice.</p>
    <p>Even if the total power consumption is exactly 600W and doesn’t require an additional connector, NVIDIA might still prefer using two connectors to distribute the load between them, reducing the chances of issues such as overheating and connector melting. It’s also possible that NVIDIA will label both connectors as 600W to avoid user confusion, ensuring that one isn’t misused if it’s rated for 150W or 300W.</p>
    <p>The image at the beginning of this article is a Photoshop edit by TweakTown, showing how such a card might look. The need for two 16-pin connectors will likely make older power supplies obsolete for NVIDIA’s next flagship. However, NVIDIA might provide an adapter to convert two or three 8-pin PCIe connectors into one 16-pin connector for the second input. In such a scenario, the primary 12V-2x6 connector will still need to be a 600W unit compliant with ATX 3.0 or ATX 3.1 standards.</p>

    <h2>Bad News for Older Power Supplies</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/powersupply.jpeg" alt="Older Power Supplies" loading="lazy">
    <p>Unfortunately, most of the new ATX 3.0 or ATX 3.1 power supplies on the market only come with one 16-pin connector. However, some PSU manufacturers are already offering powerful models with two 12V-2x6 connectors. These PSUs typically exceed 1300W in capacity. A notable example is the 2200W Seasonic Prime PX-2200W PSU, which launched earlier this week. This power supply not only offers high power output but also comes with four 12V-2x6 connectors. Another recent release is the 1600W MSI MEG AI1600T PCIE5 PSU, which includes two 600W 12V-2x6 connectors for powering a graphics card.</p>
