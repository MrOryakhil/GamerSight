        <h1>Intel Releases Microcode Update 0x12B for Raptor Lake Processors</h1>
        <img src="../newsphotos/intel.jpg" alt="Intel" loading="lazy">
        <p>Intel has recently released the third microcode update, numbered 0x12B, to address the Vmin Shift instability issue in its Raptor Lake processors. New tests indicate that this update significantly reduces the performance of the Core i9 13900K and 14900K processors.</p>
        <p>According to WCCFtech, Intel's 0x12B patch, which was published a few days ago, aims to enhance the stability of the 13th and 14th generation Core i9 processors. Intel previously claimed that the performance impact of this update would be minor and negligible, typically below one percent, only observable in specific benchmarks such as Cinebench R23, Speedometer, and Crossmark.</p>
        <p>However, it seems that with the new patch 0x12B, the performance decline is greater than Intel's assertions. Chiphell forum users have reported significant performance drops in the Core i9 13900K during benchmarks. Additionally, other changes, such as the removal of the option to disable C1E state in the BIOS, which was crucial for reducing strain on the processor and enhancing its stability, have been noted after applying this patch.</p>
        <p>For example, in the Cinebench R15 benchmark, the Core i9 13900K exhibited a 6.5% performance drop, with its single-threaded score dropping from 330-340 to 314. This processor now performs weaker compared to the Ryzen 7 7700X, which scores around 320 points.</p>
        <p>In other tests like Cinebench R23, the multi-core score of the Core i9-14900K dropped to 37,276, whereas it typically scores above 38,000 in this benchmark. This approximately 2% performance decline, while seeming minor, exceeds Intel's claimed statistical error margin. This drop in performance has placed this processor behind the Ryzen 9 7950X, which scores around 37,500.</p>
        <p>It appears that users will have to accept this performance decline unless they are willing to risk permanent damage to their processors. Those looking to build a new system with Intel processors may consider opting for mid-range or budget Raptor Lake CPUs instead of Core i9 processors or ensure that their motherboards are equipped with the appropriate BIOS patch for the 13th and 14th generations.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the release of Core Ultra 200 processors is approaching, and Intel has promised that these processors will not face instability issues.</p>
