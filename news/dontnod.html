        <h2>Recent Games Fall Short of Expectations</h2>
        <p>
            French game developer Dontnod Entertainment has announced its intention to refocus efforts on attracting a broader audience. This shift comes after their recent games, <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em> and <em>Jusant</em>, failed to meet the studio's commercial expectations.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>"We are undoubtedly disappointed with our recent performance in a highly competitive market. Despite receiving positive critical acclaim, <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em> and <em>Jusant</em> unfortunately did not achieve the commercial success we anticipated, leading to a decline in our financial results for the first half of 2024," the company stated in its latest financial report.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Looking Ahead: Lost Records: Bloom & Rage</h2>
        <p>
            To counter these setbacks, Dontnod is focusing on future releases. The studio's next game, <em>Lost Records: Bloom & Rage</em>, is being developed by the company's Montreal branch, with the creators of <em>Life is Strange</em> leading the project. This new title follows the story of four friends who reunite after 27 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first part of <em>Lost Records: Bloom & Rage</em> will launch on February 18, 2025, with the second part scheduled for release one month later.
