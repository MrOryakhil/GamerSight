    <h1>Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Announces New Policy on Sharing User Data with Legal Authorities</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/paveldurov.jpg" alt="Pavel Durov" loading="lazy">
    <p>After numerous legal battles surrounding the arrest of Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov, it seems the messaging platform’s stance on sharing user information with legal and governmental entities has shifted. Under specific circumstances, user details may now be shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>According to Bloomberg, Pavel Durov announced in a post on Telegram that the platform will begin providing users' IP addresses and phone numbers in response to legitimate legal requests. This marks a significant shift from Telegram's previous approach, where it was known for ignoring content removal requests and often disregarded information requests related to suspected criminals.</p>
    <p>Along with these changes, a content monitoring and management system has been implemented, utilizing both artificial intelligence and human moderators to remove “problematic” content from search results. Durov also urged users to report unsafe or illegal content so that Telegram can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>Implications for Telegram’s User Base</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/telegram.webp" alt="telegram" loading="lazy">
    <p>It is still unclear how these changes will impact Telegram's popularity among individuals engaged in illegal activities or the authorities' ability to track them. While IP addresses and phone numbers may be sufficient to identify users in other applications, Telegram offers several features that enhance user anonymity. These include disappearing messages, end-to-end encryption, and the ability to create accounts without a SIM card.</p>
    <p>Telegram’s FAQ section continues to claim that, "To date, ‘zero’ bytes of user messages have been disclosed to third parties, including governmental actors," reflecting the platform’s ongoing commitment to user privacy.</p>

    <h2>Pavel Durov’s Legal Struggles</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/legal.jpg" alt="legal problems" loading="lazy">
    <p>In August this year, Durov was arrested in France on charges related to crimes committed on Telegram. He is currently released under certain conditions but is not allowed to leave France. Although Durov denies the allegations and claims he holds no responsibility for the crimes, the recent policy changes reflect the growing pressure on Telegram from government authorities worldwide, particularly regarding illegal and criminal content.</p>
