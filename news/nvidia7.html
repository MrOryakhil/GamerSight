    <h1>Nvidia's New Unified App for Graphics Management</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/nvidia-app-1.jpg" alt="nvidia-app photo" loading="lazy">
    <p>In recent years, the settings for Nvidia's gaming graphics cards have been split between two applications: Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. Now, it seems Nvidia has decided to replace both with a single integrated application called Nvidia App.</p>
    <p>Nvidia is launching a new software called "App," which will serve as a unified tool for managing all settings related to GeForce graphics cards. This software will incorporate features from GeForce Experience and replace the old Nvidia Control Panel. While GeForce Experience was well-received, many gamers were reluctant to install it, partly due to the requirement of having a user account.</p>
    <p>In contrast, the Nvidia Control Panel has long been a simple and practical tool but has not received significant updates and feels outdated in design. With the introduction of Nvidia App, Nvidia aims to combine all these capabilities into a single software with a modern user interface, gradually transferring the options available in both programs to the App.</p>
    <p>Nvidia has confirmed that Nvidia App will exit beta by the end of this year, and users of GeForce Experience will need to migrate to this new software. This means that GeForce Experience will likely no longer receive new updates, and it has been several months since its last update. Therefore, if you're still using this tool, it's best to prepare for the transition to Nvidia App.</p>
    <p>One notable feature of Nvidia App that has gained attention is the ability to roll back drivers to a previous version. This allows users to easily revert to an earlier driver version in case of performance issues without needing to re-download the drivers. The app also supports RTX HDR mode when using multiple monitors.</p>
    <p>In recent updates, Nvidia has added G-Sync features and new capabilities to customize the HUD appearance in Nvidia App. This update allows users to change the color of displayed fonts. Additionally, optimization profiles for various games have now been added to Nvidia App, enabling users to automatically apply the best settings suited for their system.</p>
