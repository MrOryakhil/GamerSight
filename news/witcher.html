    <p>In a recent podcast, Mr. Sasco shared an interesting story:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "A few years ago, I saw a mod video, and I was amazed by its quality. I asked Phillip Weber, the narrative director who was once a modder himself, about the creator of the mod. I told him to message the person and ask them to send their resume to our studio. He did that, and after reviewing their background and a few tests, we accepted the modder.<br /><br />
         We spoke to him several times in 2020 and 2021. At the time, he was living in Australia, working with his tractor on a turnip farm and modding in the afternoons. His name is Eero Varendi, and that same year, we were able to bring him from Australia to Poland. He is an incredibly kind and enthusiastic person with an immense passion for The Witcher world. He now plays a key role in the development of The Witcher Polaris."
    </blockquote>    
    <p>Currently, several games from The Witcher franchise are in development. In addition to <strong>The Witcher 4</strong>, a spin-off and a remake of the first game in the series are also being worked on, which fans are very excited about. Mr. Sasco previously mentioned that The Witcher 4 is the most advanced game ever made by CD Projekt Red.</p>
