        <p>According to a report from PSU, Microsoft has launched a new survey on its official website to gather feedback from game developers and users of rival consoles. The survey includes a question that reads, “If you are not a user of Xbox consoles, we would love to know why. We are genuinely interested in hearing from those who use our competitors' consoles, as your insights are valuable and can teach us a lot.”</p>

        <p>Microsoft explained that the company’s experts do not want to approach the situation from a one-sided perspective, focusing only on their own views. Instead, they believe that hearing the opinions of those outside their user community could greatly aid their future plans.</p>

        <p>Both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X were launched around the same time and are similar in terms of hardware capabilities and consumer pricing. However, it is widely recognized that Microsoft struggles to compete with Sony in the console market, with PS5 sales vastly outpacing Xbox. Although Microsoft has not publicly shared its console sales figures for some time, reports indicate that the ratio of PlayStation to Xbox sales has more than tripled in favor of PlayStation.</p>

        <p>In recent years, Microsoft has adopted a multi-platform approach, releasing several of its once-exclusive games on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms. This trend seems set to continue, with the upcoming release of *Indiana Jones and the Great Circle* for PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

        <p>It appears that Microsoft is now aiming to analyze all aspects of the market as it works to refine its strategy for the next generation of consoles, seeking to make the best possible decisions to ensure success in a competitive environment.</p>
