        <p>The 2024 Windows 11 update brings a remarkable boost in file transfer speed, significantly increasing copy performance. This advancement is made possible by the resilient file system (ReFS), which has transitioned from servers to desktops and laptops. One of the key features of this technology is block-level cloning, which accelerates file copying operations like never before. Read on for more details and how to enable it.</p>

        <p>ReFS, which has been used in Microsoftâ€™s server products since 2012, serves as an alternative to NTFS, which remains the default file system for regular Windows users. ReFS offers distinct advantages for data centers and environments with high volumes of read/write operations.</p>

        <h2>Enabling ReFS in Windows 11 for Faster File Copying</h2>
        <img src="../newsphotos/chart.jpg" alt="windows-11 photo" loading="lazy">

        <p>One of ReFS' standout features is the "block cloning" technology, which dramatically improves file copy speeds. According to Microsoft, this technology increases copy speed by 18% for 1 MB files and up to 94% for 1 GB files compared to NTFS. Even for large folders, there is an 80% speed improvement. For example, copying an 18 GB folder now takes just 6 seconds, whereas it previously took over 30 seconds.</p>

        <p>In addition to speed enhancements, ReFS offers the ability to automatically check the health of data, identifying and removing corrupt data without affecting other parts of the disk.</p>

        <p>Despite all the benefits, ReFS is not primarily designed for everyday users and does come with limitations. These include a lack of support for certain NTFS features such as file compression and encryption. Additionally, ReFS cannot be used as the boot drive for the operating system, and there is no direct conversion between NTFS and ReFS, requiring a full drive format instead.</p>

        <p>Because of this, Microsoft has introduced ReFS in Windows 11 as an auxiliary drive under the name "Dev Drive." It is specifically designed for developers, IT professionals, and power users who handle large datasets. Microsoft recommends using ReFS for ongoing projects, while NTFS should still be used for the operating system, applications, and personal data.</p>

        <p>Setting up a Dev Drive with ReFS is straightforward. Users who previously had to rely on the old disk management tools can now perform this task through the modern Windows settings app. Simply go to Windows Settings and navigate to System > Storage > Advanced Storage Settings > Disks & Volumes, then select "Create dev drive."</p>
