    <h1>Intel Announces Launch Date for Arrow Lake-S Desktop Processors</h1>
    <img src="../newsphotos/intel-200-1.jpg" alt="intel-200" loading="lazy">
    <p>Intel has finally released a statement revealing the launch date of its next-generation desktop processors, the Core Ultra 200 series. These processors are set to officially hit the market on November 3, 2024 (October 24, 2024). You can read more about the detailed timeline of these processors on City of Hardware.</p>
    <p>Intel has not only announced the release date for its new desktop processors, but it has also introduced a new platform that supports the LGA-1851 socket. This socket will replace the LGA-1700 after three years.</p>
    <p>Before unveiling these processors, Intel has invited the press to a special session on October 7, 2024, to share key details about the Core Ultra 200 processors. However, the media is prohibited from publishing this information until October 10, 2024.</p>
    <h2>Delayed Launch of Intel's Arrow Lake-S Processors</h2>
    <img src="../newsphotos/intel-3.jpg" alt="intel-200" loading="lazy">
    <p>According to reports from techpowerup, Intel will officially unveil the Core Ultra 200 processors on October 10, 2024, with the processors reaching the market two weeks later on October 24, 2024 (November 3, 2024).</p>
    <p>The first series of Arrow Lake-S processors will include five models: Core Ultra 9 285K, Core Ultra 7 256K, 256KF, Core Ultra 5 245K, and 245KF. These processors will feature high-performance Lion Cove cores and energy-efficient Skymont cores.</p>
    <p>Following Intel's trend over the past few years, the release of both the K-series and standard Core Ultra 200 series processors will be staggered by a few months. This means consumers will likely have to wait until early next year to purchase budget-friendly processors and mid-range motherboards.</p>
    <p>The high-end flagship processor, Core Ultra 9 285K, was previously listed with a price of around $625. The Core Ultra 7 265K is priced at $431, while the KF version will cost $415. It is rumored that the mid-range Core Ultra 5 245K will be priced at $330, with the KF version (which lacks a GPU) being priced at $313.</p>
