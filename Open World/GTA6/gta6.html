            <h2>Release Date</h2>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>We all know how Rockstar keeps the information of their games in secret that in last year we didn’t have much leaks about GTA 6 until in 2022 February 4 in social media.<br />
                    The internet was bombed no one could believe that it is really happened fans started talking about rumors, like it is going to be a GTA IV remaster….<br />
                    Until in 2024 December first a simple image of an artwork released from Rockstar’s official social media account saying (Trailer 1 Tuesday, December 5, 9 Am ET) fans then started inspecting the artwork and rumors started.<br />
                    Fans were eagerly waiting for the trailer release date and surprisingly it leaked somehow earlier at December 4 2023.<br />
                    In trailer the release date is 2025 which they narrowed down to fall 2025 in a financial report.<br /></p>
